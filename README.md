## Presentation

Welcome in [Aquarium](https://fatfi.sh/aquarium) addon for [Ayon](https://ynput.io/ayon/). ðŸŽ‰

With this addon, you will be able to connect your projects from Ayon and Aquarium to synchronize your data. You can also create new Aquarium projects, using your existing Ayon projects.

This addon is composed by 3 main parts:

- [Client](#client)
- [Server](#server)
  - API
  - Frontend
- [Services](#services)
  - Leecher
  - Processor

### Directory structure

#### Client

Client code is used in the [Ayon Launcher](https://github.com/ynput/ayon-launcher), the AYON pipeline desktop application.

#### Server

Python server-side part of the addon. It's mainly used to declare specific addon API endpoints, used by the leecher and processor services to keep your data in sync.

It's also responsible to decalre specific addon settings, in your Ayon server and project settings.

##### Frontend

This folder is used to provide a web UI in your Ayon settings to pair projects between Ayon and Aquarium and also to trigger a full project sync.


#### Services

Syncing data between Ayon and Aquarium relies on [Ayon services system](https://ayon.ynput.io/docs/dev_event_system).

This addon use two components:

- **Leecher**
  - It's listenning Aquarium's events, and store them into Ayon database for async processing.
- **Processor**
  - It's looking for specific Aquarium events in Ayon's database and process them to transform data into compatible Ayon's structure and send request to addon server API endpoints to interact with the server.
